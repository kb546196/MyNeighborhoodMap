# Neighborhood Map Project

This is a project is for the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). 

The project aim is to develop a single-page application featuring a map of a neighborhood, with map markers to identify popular locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. Plus use of  third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations

###Overview

This project uses JavaScript, jQuery, knockoutJS, bootstrap, Google Maps API, and Musixmatch API to create a map of the places in London, England that have inspired songs which are marked on the map. Each marker when opened then has lyrics from the song from Musixmatch and link to Wikipedia about information about the area.
